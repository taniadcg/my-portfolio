# My Portfolio

This repository contains my programming portfolio, showcasing various projects I've worked on in different languages and frameworks. Below is an overview of the folder structure and the projects included.

## Overview of Projects

### Python Projects
- **Pose Estimation and Exercise Repetition Counting**: This project uses Python to analyze movement data and count exercise repetitions.
- **Folders Synchronization**: Synchronizes two folders.

### JavaScript Projects
- **3D Racing Track Scenario**: 3D Modeling and Augmented Reality with JavaScript, WebGL and HTLM.
