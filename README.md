# My Portfolio

This repository contains my programming portfolio, showcasing various projects I've worked on in different languages and frameworks. Below is an overview of the folder structure and the projects included.

## Overview of Projects

### Deep Learning and AI Projects 
- **Computer Vision and Object Classification and Detection Project**: Computer Vision and Object Classification and Detection Project
- **Convolutional Neural Networks Project**: Convolutional Neural Networks Project
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Deep Reinforcement Learning

### JavaScript Projects
- **3D Racing Track Scenario**: 3D Modeling and Augmented Reality with JavaScript, WebGL and HTLM.

### Python Projects
- **Pose Estimation and Exercise Repetition Counting**: This project uses Python to analyze movement data and count exercise repetitions.
- **Folders Synchronization**: Synchronizes two folders.

## Portfolio Status
**Note:** Some folders, features and projects in this portfolio are still under development and may not be fully implemented. Please check back later for updates, or feel free to explore the current features that are available.
